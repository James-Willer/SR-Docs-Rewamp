# Tech support scams
Your average day toggling on your PC messaging people or browsing the web. Nothing odd. Then, suddenly, your screen starts flickering and beep sounds come out. It says your computer has a virus! But luckily, there is a number you can callâ€¦
# How do they work
After you call that number, a scammer posing as a technician will tell you to let him access your PC via remote software control to then abuse the power. He can look through your private data, try to get you to access your bank, install even more malware on your PC, etc.
# How to bait
What you can do to piss these people off is to, make them believe you fell for this scam. You can set up a VM and act as if that is your actual computer, giving them access to it without risking your own data. Just be sure to set up a lot of fake data to make it actually believable. And of course you can always make them waste a lot of time pretending that something takes long. If your screen blackens, that is usually a technique scammers use to make their victims not see what they are actually doing. 
# Requirements
A VM, preferably Windows 10 or 11, lot of fake data, preferably some online persona too. If you're dealing with some guy that wants to get to your bank, then a fake bank too.
