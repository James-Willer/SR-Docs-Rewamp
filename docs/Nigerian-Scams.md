# Nigerian Scams

Imagine, one day, you come home from a long day and you want to rest in your sofa with your coffee and just enjoy your life before it ends. And then you get a phone call. Is it your annoying boss, your old classmate, or the electricity company complaining you didn't pay your bills? No. It's the Nigerian prince! And he wants to send you some money! 

## How do they work?

In '419' scams (called so because 419 is the country code for Nigeria, and the Nigerian Prince scam is the most famously known 419 scam), you'll receive an email, usually from someone claiming to be extremely rich. For whatever reason, they'll say they need to transfer money through your account, and they'll tell you that you will get a handsome cut of the money (some scammers pretend to be businesses giving out loans or looking to find business partners). After getting your personal details (usually to sell online to others), they will usually ask you for a 'small' fee, usually via apps like PayPal, Western Union, CashApp and Zelle. Once you've given them the money, they'll ghost you. 

## What to do against them?

Give the scammers fake information, like fake accounts and fake banks, and try to waste their time by "entering the wrong password" or something alike. 
Also, report the scams on [scammer.info](https://scammer.info/).

## Requirements for 419 scams:

A fake account on some bank or PayPal service, you don't need a VM, however you do need lots of humour and time, try to not laugh. ðŸ‘€ 

## Troubleshooting:

What to do if all goes wrong? Well first of all don't panic, you can always just hang up the phone and turn off your phone/PC, they won't be able to do anything anymore. Block the number, turn off everything for 10 or so minutes, etc. . .
