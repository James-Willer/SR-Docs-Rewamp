For whatever reason, they‚Äôll say they need to transfer money through your account, and they‚Äôll tell you that you will get a handsome cut of the money (some scammers pretend to be businesses giving out loans or looking to find business partners). After getting your personal details (usually to sell online to others), they will usually ask you for a ‚Äòsmall‚Äô fee, usually via apps like PayPal, Western Union, CashApp and Zelle. Once you‚Äôve given them the money, they‚Äôll ghost you. ",
